                    <div id="abstract1" class="abstract">
                        <p>Descartes writes in his <em>Meditations</em>: “This is similar to the way in which we might ‘see’ people down in the street when all we really see are coats and hats. 
                            Our intellect—and not our eyes—judges that there are people, and not automata, under those coats and hats.” But what if these “people” or “automata” started 
                            collectively slipping and falling or throwing pies at each other? We end with humour and Bergson’s famous diagnosis: “The attitudes, gestures and movements of 
                            the human body are laughable in exact proportion as that body reminds us of a mere machine.” We laugh at human automatisms, but we at the same time laugh 
                            mechanically, or as Bergson puts it: “Laughter is simply the result of a mechanism set up in us by nature”. The comic may “not exist outside the pale of what is 
                            strictly HUMAN”, but is in a way a mediation between two automatisms: the mechanical activity laughed at and the mechanical laugh. Humour may be a corrective, but in the name of what: 
                            humanism or inhumanism? De Quincey's Kant may be the absentminded comic character Bergson is talking about, but let's not forget Bergson that becomes one too when debating Einstein.

With Primož Krašovec, he co-edits the <em>Izhodi/Exits</em> book series (at the publishing house Sophia), which seeks links between humanities, science, technology and literature.

                <p>Lea Sande (University of Ljubljana) & Tisa Troha (Šum, Ljubljana): <span class="collapsible" onclick="toggleContent('abstract2')">Inhuman vectors</span></p>
                    <div id="abstract2" class="abstract">
                        <p>As the gap  in  capabilities  between  artificial  neural  networks  and  humans  seems to be unavoidably closing, we are drowning in the incomprehensible buzz of hype, fear and denial. The technology gradually developed over the last few decades, is often portrayed as something both altogether newborn and at  the  same  time entirely too abstract and alien to be considered human in any capacity. Historically, antihumanisms can be construed as more or less discrete deconstructions of humanist exceptionalism’s many manifestations, while still proceeding from its essentialist premises all the same. An attempt at stating this pseudo-dichotomy’s central problem anew,  inhumanism is a  distillation of the  human rational  core as the  capacity-for and commitment-to continuous normative self-revision in the discursive space of reasons. In this paper, we argue that there are meaningful similarities between how large language models (LLMs') and humans structure our respective images of the world, and that these similarities can inform our self-understanding and our commitments. To this end, we present a preliminary exploration of artificial neural networks (ANN's) as the mirror of humanity’s self-examination in view of how LLMs’ latent spaces robustly embed semantic maps of meaning as vectors. The same process is at work in platform user data embeddings, materialised through informing corporations’ counterintuitive algorithmic meta manoeuvres with massive quantities of vectorized behavioural data. Through the lens of a disembodied topological model of reason and in light of speculative insight into the metastability of LLMs’ semiotically encoded orientation, we see the volatility of ANN’s vectorial value alignment not only as a challenge, but simultaneously as a chance.

                    <div id="abstract3" class="abstract">
                        <p>A definition of the spectral plane as a non-binary alternative to the physical-mental dichotomy and accentuating its importance in the context of modern philosophy and political discourses. An attempt at creating its “map” made up of memes of the spectral plane that replace ever-changing utterances and buzzwords with their stationary subjective and moral location inside the plane. A discussion about the inhuman nature of humanity as an entiry of collective consciousness confronting the individual and territories that said individual consequently draws in order to reclaim the illusion of power and agency. A link between spectral and physical territories, the city as an identity/discourse/avatar.

                <p>Bogna Konior (New York University, Shanghai): <span class="collapsible" onclick="toggleContent('abstract4')">Existential technologies: For an Eastern European theory of technological evolution</span></p>
                    <div id="abstract4" class="abstract">
                        <p>This talk explores the possibility of an Eastern European philosophy of technology, focusing on its inhuman or posthuman potential. Drawing on the works of Polish novelist, philosopher, and doctor Stanisław Lem, it examines how his writings reflected Poland's modern history, investigating why Eastern European intellectuals, unlike those in many other post-colonial and post-imperial regions at the time, embraced rather than rejected technological acceleration. It also considers how Lem's technological perspective challenges both humanist principles and dominant philosophies of his time, presenting a distinct "antihumanist stance" informed by his experiences of Nazi and Soviet occupations, his education as a doctor of medicine with an interest in biotechnology, and his studies of theology, information theory, and philosophy. Re-reading his work in the contemporary moment, the talk argues that technology itself is not merely a vessel for political and social dynamics, but an inhuman and not fully controllable causality. Furthermore, it explores possibilities for technological design that align with long-term evolutionary pathways, rather than contingent social morality.

                <p><span class="collapsible" onclick="toggleContent('abstract5')">Peripheral visions of alternative futures: Feminist technoimaginaries</span></p>
                    <div id="abstract5" class="abstract">
                        <p>Technologically permeated societies are a global reality, and feminist, queer, critical race, decolonial, and crip theories are pivotal in offering critical analyses and ways of imagining, producing, and using technologies differently. This round table offers a sneak peek into a special issue of the journal <em>Feminist Encounters</em> dedicated to feminist techno-imaginaries (upcoming in Autumn 2025). The issue re-inspects the entanglements between technology and imagination from a range of feminist perspectives in disciplines like STS, philosophy and critical theory, media history and media archaeology, cultural history, and cultural and comparative literature studies. Guest-edited by Katja Čičigoj, Natalija Majsova, and Jasmina Šepetavc, the issue brings together diverse contributions that articulate in novel ways how, through emancipatory social imaginaries of technological innovation, technology and feminism impact one another in modern societies. Anti-humanist theoretical legacies and their recent post-humanist articulations have offered important resources to feminists and other peripherally positioned subjects for articulating their exclusion from mainstream technological design, development, and use, and for imagining alternatives. Yet it remains difficult to see how one can utterly divorce feminist, queer, critical race, and decolonial emancipatory takes on technology from a humanist ethos and theoretical framework: how can we reflect upon oppressive and emancipatory forms of technology development and use without reference to humanist notions such as agency, responsibility, or justice? Inhabiting this tension constitutive of emancipatory theories' and practices' relation to anti- and posthumanist thought, this round table refracts the main theme of the conference by speaking to it from a variety of feminist and emancipatory perspectives.

                    <div id="abstract6" class="abstract">
                        <p>Althusserian theoretical antihumanism must be understood in terms of the complex and multi-layered reasons that motivate it. Firstly, at historiographical reason: basing his argumentation on the concept of ‘problematics’, elaborated in a famous passage from the <em>German ideology</em>, as well as on the concept of <em>coupure</em> taken from Bachelardian epistemology, Althusser elaborates a reconstruction of Marxian thought that allows us to identify its originality precisely in its distancing from Feuerbach's theoretical humanism. This historiographical reconstruction allows Althusser to take a theoretical position that we could summarise in the terms of a structuralist reading of Marxism that is both in dialogue and in critical tension with the Lacanian reading of Freud. This theoretical reason brings with it two important political stances: on the one hand, a stance against so-called Western Marxism, which by valorising the Feuerbachian humanism of the <em>Manuscripts of 1944</em> in fact offers an interclassist reading of Marx, and, on the other hand against Krushcov's socialist humanism that ends up not coming to terms with Stalinism. From this reconstruction we will try to explore the limits and prospects of these stances for the contemporary theoretical-political horizon.

They usually portray a story that is familiar to everyone, and at the same time, are suspiciously artificial and trite: “Moon" is usually close to “June”, love is ordinary, and the speaking subject is somehow fake. This is particularly evident in the big data approach we use to analyse the music lyrics of popular songs on Slovenian radio stations and digital platforms in the Western Balkans region. Our research builds on previous studies on music lyrics (Frith, Peatman 1944, Mooney 1954, Hirsch 1971, Gerschwin 1971, DeWall et al. 2011, Interiano et al. 2018), which showed how changes in song lyrics reflect social changes. Today’s change in song lyrics, which seems to favour anti-social and materialistic value systems (as many critics of today’s mainstream rap have noted), is structurally similar to that which took place in the earlier days of pop culture between the 1950s and 1960s, when “unconventional messages about sex, drugs and politics” (Hirsch 1971) became much more popular. In both cases, it seems surprising that the counterculture is always being appropriated by the “alien" agency of capital/technology. We are all trapped in our pop culture dreams, in love stories we never experienced. We are all trapped, as Brian Massumi argued: “in identical suburban homes, in predictable careers, in adorable hobbies that offer controlled reconnection with subhuman part-objects as long as they don’t get out of hand. Have you seen my rock collection?”.

                        <p>In early 2024, several competing applications, accessible to the general public emerged which, with the help of generative artificial intelligence, deliver relatively convincing music products based on the input of a few keywords or descriptions. Reactions to this innovation from more and less established musicians have predictably been overwhelmingly dismissive, relying on familiar discursive formulations about “true” artistic practice, which is based on the expressive individual elevating his or her sense of the world into elaborate aesthetic forms. 
                            Theodor W. Adorno was also an heir to the Romantic conception of artistic practice. In this paper, I will first briefly show how his theory of standardisation can be approached without assuming a humanistic starting point. On this theoretical basis, I will argue that the products of Suno, Udio and other software applications for the generation of musical works offer, almost for the first time in the history of the music industry, a competing product to the established form of mass production and consumption of musical products. Namely: the change in the very form of musical commodity promised by AI generated music seems to make impossible a hitherto reliable business model that relies on mystifying music creators, and even their handling of musical resources. Even if the software in question is for the time being mostly used in the sphere of testing the limits of performance and generating musical memes, by exploring the specificities of this new form, and in anticipation of increasingly sophisticated generations of these applications, we can at least draw out some of the ideological and economic battlegrounds that the eventual establishment of the consumption of generated music could provoke in the future.

                    <div id="abstract10" class="abstract">
                        <p>In Marx’s critique of political economy, capital appears as a self-moving subject. By contrast, human actors are subject to the whims of accumulation: this is the antihumanistic dynamic underpinning commodity fetishism, the essence of capitalist society. But despite the anthropological diagnosis – furnishing tenets for a materialist antihumanism – Marx was far from an antihumanist. Rather, antihumanism and humanism remained in constant tension throughout his work, manifest in the unrealised possibility for human life beyond capitalist social relations. For Marx, capitalism is the negation of historically given humanity. Communism, therefore, can realise a humanistic world. For Althusser, by comparison, humanism constitutes an ‘epistemological obstacle’ impeding cognition of historical causality. Hence Althusser’s antihumanism is a theoretical, transhistorical and abstract negation of the human; Marx’s is determinate.  
                            <br><br>For Marx, the ‘essence’ of human life famously migrates into praxis. This enables a reinterpretation of humanity as a historically specific ‘ensemble of social relations’. This displacement, however, does not resolve epistemological difficulties regarding the place of physiology and the positive sciences within Marx’s depiction of humanity. This paper contends that the method Marx employs to expound his anthropology in Capital establishes a permanent dialectical tension between the (antihumanist) life of capital’s self-movement and concrete life. In doing so, Marx challenges the reality and idea of capital’s totalising formal dominance over human life and nature: capital itself is an abstract negation of the human. 
                            <br><br>By grappling with this issue, through Marx and Althusser, analysis might identify issues pertinent to human life and nature’s reproduction beyond capital, possibilities that challenge capital’s own self-reproduction. How might the abstract negation of the human acquire a determinate politics today?

                        <p>The contribution takes as its point of departure the evolutionary theory of André Leroi-Gourhan, which is based on the thesis that with the appearance of new brain possibilities there begins a lightning rise of techniques that move along lines that so closely imitate phyletic evolution that they are in essence no different from a direct continuation of a general development of the species. We intuitively conceive of these exosomatic techniques as the noble fruits of human intelligence, but paradoxically intelligence is more a product of technique than technique is a product of intelligence. Thus, we will deal first with Leroi-Gourhan's theory and the understanding of human intelligence in contrast to animal intelligence, and then with technical objects in which epiphylogenetic memory is imprinted and externalised, and are therefore morphologically connected in the social structure and inseparable from speech. The human secretion of memory in the form of language represents the leap of human evolution from the anatomical body to the social body and speech continues its leap in the formation of cultures and ethnicities; at the same time, it represents the course of technical evolution from the technical integration of more or less specialised limbs to the elimination of organ-tools, a seemingly polar opposite process. A similar evolutionary leap in the innovation and diversification of technical objects from one organism to another occurs with the emergence and evolution of capitalism, which—as once man did—represents the driving force of technical development, but at the same time necessarily forms the area of ​​coexistence of two seemingly opposite systems—speech and technique. In conclusion, the paper discusses the various modalities of the coexistence of speech and techniques within various socio-technical dispositifs, which take on new forms and carry various implications through the historical formation of capital.

                    <div id="abstract12" class="abstract">
                        <p>Antihumanism has posed a challenge to the notion of dialectics, since it offers a devastating critique of the subject, the figure at the core of Hegel’s rendering of dialectical thought. Figures as diverse as Moishe Postone and Alain Badiou, however, have pointed to the possibility of rethinking dialectics by taking the antihumanist critique of the subject into account. In this paper, I work out my own attempt to think dialectics through a non-subject: the proletariat, which I define as that which is left out of the human (that is, of whatever is constructed, in a given society, as human). In order to understand the movement of this non-subject in history, I draw on early formalist and structuralist theories of narrative and on recent posthumanist anthropology. I consider how a character’s story can be narrated as a dialectical structure, in which the hero may not be strictly human, but may operate alongside demons, spirits, and all sorts of fictions (and where all heroes are always already fictitious, even when they are real). At the same time, my purpose is to understand the appeal of humanism, which endures despite its apparent theoretical weakness. I ask how the exclusion of a character from humanity generates a desire for humanity—the proletariat’s exclusion from bourgeois humanism generates a desire for the appropriation of the human, while artificial intelligence’s apparent threat to the boundaries of the human generates a desire to grasp the human still more strongly than before.

                        <p>In July 2014, Laboria Cuboniks, the collective pseudonymous author of <em>Xenofeminism: A politics for alienation</em> (Merve, 2015; Verso, 2018), was conceived via intellectual parthenogenesis in a bar in Berlin during a summer school on Rationalism and Left Accelerationism organised by the philosophers Peter Wolfendale and Reza Negarestani. An anagram of Nicolas Bourbaki, Laboria Cuboniks originated, like her predecessor, from circumstances that were as silly as they were significant—a social media battle between the Rationalists and Left Accelerationists and their critics about the alleged absence of women among their ranks. Ten years later, the ‘Xenofeminist manifesto’ has been translated into eighteen languages, influenced dance, music, and theatre projects, been named as a key influence on works featured in major international art exhibitions, and cited in numerous academic books and articles. However, the deeper political and philosophical implications of xenofeminism remain unrealised and underexplored. As a founding member of Laboria Cuboniks and a co-author of the manifesto, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on the legacy of xenofeminism, its strengths, its shortcomings, and in particular those aspects of the manifesto that are the most philosophically unique but due to being politically abstract and conceptually abstruse, have often been overlooked in favour of more recognisable elements.

                    <div id="abstract14" class="abstract">
                        <p>In this presentation, we revisit xenofeminist concepts in light of recent shifts in biohacking culture, wellness trends, and digital health innovations. Inspired by a fascination with Bro Science and Paleo Moms, our aim is to suggest that (xeno)feminist principles might emerge from unexpected sources. Advances in biotechnology, medicine, and nutritional engineering, as well as their popularisation in digital media, enable us to surpass bodily limits in ways that parallel technological manipulation. The DIY approach of soft biohacking subverts standard medical practices, often ignoring conventional notions of bodily "normalcy" in favour of individually optimised health, thus promoting a democratised, n-of-1 perspective that can align with xenofeminist commitments to inclusivity and bodily agency. Although often implicitly or explicitly affirming the notion of optimal, natural states as a given, these developments have the potential to challenge traditional medico-pharmacological paradigms, suggesting that transformative changes in gender and bodily politics could arise through the opportunistic hacking of existing practices. By contrasting terms like cyborg/holobiont, bio/hacking, health-/self-care, and individualism/n=1 experiments, we explore how contemporary wellness and health discourses intersect with feminist inhumanism. This intersection commits to the constant revisability of the rational and natural, challenging biological determinism and the ‘natural’ hierarchies that constrain bodies. Finally, we provide tentative examples of how popular-scientific health interventions can be repurposed to construct “zero-cost-to-consumers” protocols for xenofeminist futures.

                    <div id="abstract15" class="abstract">
                        <p>In the last two decades, queer studies have turned to a materialistic analysis of the placement of binary gender in the material conditions of capitalism, but in this theoretical production we rarely find analyses of real socialist societies as a source of insight into the ways of shaping gender emancipation policies. In my contribution, I start from the thesis that this among other things, is a result of the analysis of real socialism through the epistemological lens of the Western theory of gender and sexuality. In my research focus, therefore, I follow the proposal of Keti Chukhrov, i.e. that before analysing any of policies (sexual emancipation) within the framework of real socialism, we should first try to understand these policies according to the logic of the functioning of social formation in which they originated.
                            <br><br>The central part of the paper is therefore an analysis of the location of Western queer cultural policy as individual subversions of the dominant culture within the capitalist social formation.
                            <br><br>With the help of Marxist critiques of queer theory, I define the epistemological trap within which queer, as we understand it in capitalism, appears as a universal theoretical tool, as a consequence of abstracting the discursive dimensions of gender and sexuality from historically specific modes of production, which make possible (both normatively and subversively) the discursive field at all. I then examine the relationship between the occurrence of “queer” cultural politics and the material conditions of its creation through a case study of a specific socialist social formation in the Soviet Union, within which Keti Chukhrov and Bogdan Popa discuss about the specific logic of the cultural policy of sexual emancipation, which is not constituted as a difference to the dominant culture, but represents a means of creating a biopolitical reality, which would as much as possible correspond with the material conditions of the mode of production.

                        <p>In a state above existence on Earth, ethereal human life-forms on the verge of total Godhood go on homicidal missions directed against 1) all-too-human ersatz representations of a false path to deification; and 2) the individual and intimate bind that connects a human being to life and the world. Pico della Mirandola has a vision of this state during his intense study of the history of all contact between the human race and a higher intelligence – the texts of world theology –, and, after separating cases of true contact from false contact, in his 900 Theses and Oration on the Dignity of Man describes a method for human deification and species/life transcendence. God has made man the dominant species on Earth, which is reflected in the control man has over all life through his existence as a perfected killing technology on Earth. But if the human species is truly in control, it must perform an esoteric (self)homicide so as to go beyond itself and the world. A homicidal God executes the directives of a higher intelligence which are communicated through the prophets and avatars this higher intelligence sends to Earth, establishing a behavioural prototype the human being is to replicate in order to kill off whatever binds him to a default inferior anthropological state. But a homicidal God has to also hunt down and assassinate external and counterfeit deification methods: 1) false becomings of a Spinozian type, i.e., schizoanalytic-become-anything-you-desire Nietzschean/Deleuzo-Guattarian life affirmation; 2) false behavioural prototypes claiming to have had contact with a higher intelligence; and 3) European Union/psychoanalytic “enjoy your symptom”-type humanisms, which maintain that the human is the crown of creation even in an incomplete pathological state. As outer and inner homicide come closer to their convergence, it is possible to envision a final moment on Earth, after which everything that takes place in the world can no longer have any meaning (the world has never been nihilistic enough).

                    <div id="abstract17" class="abstract">
                        <p>Even though it’s been more than five decades, we are still waiting for a systematic engagement with Deleuze and Guattari's critique of psychoanalysis by the Lacanian psychoanalytic community. This paper contextualizes key points of schizoanalysis within the three structural psychic registers in Lacanian psychoanalysis: psychosis, neurosis, and perversion. We position Deleuze and Guattari's critique of psychoanalysis as an immanent critique of the neurotic structure through the psychotic register.
                            <br><br>The essence of the psychotic register is that the signifier (or the Other) is not successfully integrated, leading to the foreclosure of the psychotic's entry into the symbolic. This shapes how the symbolic "shows itself" to the (psychotic) subject and how the subject attempts to constitute the symbolic in an immanent, autonomous way. Since the psychotic does not accept the signifier, desire does not function as lack, with no split subject and reality not yet established. Instead, desiring production involves a germinal flow of intensities, coupling and connecting in inclusive disjunctive syntheses. Thus, the psychotic subject is not a subject in the classical sense, as it follows desire at the level of intensities and not (symbolic) codes. Desiring production is therefore an intensive production, enacting desire beyond the confines of the symbolic order.
                            <br><br>In the final part of the paper, we connect these claims with Nick Land's accelerationism, arguing that Land's philosophy provides the most explicit display of the immanent intensification of desire within the psychotic register.

                    <div id="abstract19" class="abstract">
                        <p>This keynote talk addresses the legacies of antihumanism within the context of computation and its philosophy. Current developments in artificial intelligence (AI) confirm the increasing autonomy of computational automation. Present-day computing systems can make decisions and produce new data with little human involvement. In response to the social risks implicit in such proliferation of quasi-autonomous computational agents, tech companies, legislative bodies and academia alike have often argued for a ‘human-centred’ approach, which should align the programming and use of AI with human values and goals and thus supposedly make the outcomes of these machines more transparent and trustworthy. It is possible to find in the rhetoric of human-centred AI many conceptual limits that antihumanism has already identified in the foundationalist and subjectivist assumptions and aims of the Western philosophical tradition. This talk will highlight some of these challenging limitations. As part of this presentation, however, the legacies of antihumanism will also be problematised. While guiding the direction of the humanities, antihumanism missed many opportunities to reconceptualise technology anew. What should one keep and what instead should one discard of theoretical antihumanism when proposing a speculative philosophy of computation? To respond to this question, the talk will focus on the implications of moving beyond a standard anthropomorphic and anthropological horizon while maintaining subjectivity and representation as two key concepts to engage not only with computing machines, but also with the symbolic order they structurally produce and sustain.

                        <div id="abstract20" class="abstract">
                            <p>The legitimacy of humanism derives from the pretension to explain human activity as something that arises from man's own subjectivity, his free will, values and beliefs. In contrast, the Freudian psychoanalytic framework offers an alternative explanation for human activity, according to which the human psyche is defined by the laws of the psychic apparatus, so that conscious or volitional activity is only a secondary response. The economic dimension of metapsychology (the theoretical corpus of knowledge acquired through psychoanalytic practice) focuses, already in early Freud, on the dynamics of the escalation of arousal and its withdrawal, the former representing pleasure and the latter discomfort. Psychic impressions thus cause the escalation of irritation, and it is the function of the psychic apparatus to discharge it. The concept of the drive, an instinct that delivers irritation “from within” and independently of external stimuli, plays a special role in this respect. Freud's discovery of these insights led him to conceive of a libidinal economy, an economic sphere of the psyche in which trading, investing and borrowing take place, and in which psychic energy is the currency. The paper further starts from the thesis that some of the findings derived from this theoretical framework can also explain the widespread use of psychoactive substances such as alcohol, illicit drugs or psychotropic drugs such as antidepressants. Since substances, in addition to their material effects, also have effects linked to their social value, their use is closely intertwined with the libidinal economy. This paper will attempt to outline the ontology of this interplay and demonstrate the relevance of a Freudian theoretical framework for understanding agency as it manifests itself in 21st century capitalism.

                        <div id="abstract22" class="abstract">
                            <p>“It's like we are goingto war” is how a worker in a retail warehouse describes his working day. “Every month they evaluate the branches, every month you find out where you are,” says a worker in a retail branch about her work. Using the analysis of interviews with workers in retail warehouses and branches, I will show that they are at work in two different locations in the logistics chain of retail companies—in central warehouses, which are the center of the logistics chain, and in branches, which represent peripheral parts of this chain. two specific models of workforce management, which in differentiated ways ensure the productivity and meekness of workers.
                                <br><br>In warehouses, productivity and discipline are ensured by a combination of measuring the efficiency of an individual worker (the norm or the number of scanned products in a working day) and the use of exceptions in Slovenian labor legislation, which enables employment through uniform residence and work permits. Through these means, companies link the possibility of extending an employment contract with the employee's ability to achieve the norm at the workplace, and the employment contract to the residence permit in Slovenia and the European Union. In retail branches, productivity is measured differently: as a ratio between the realised turnover and the number of employees, which allows comparing the productivity of different branches, monitoring fluctuations in the productivity of one branch over time and taking immediate action when a deviation is detected in the statistics. At the same time, this approach does not require precise and continuous disciplinary control over individual workers, since achieving the required level of productivity is not the task of an individual worker, but the common goal of the collective.
                                <br><br>On the basis that central and peripheral cities within the distribution chain of retail compa-nies achieve the goal of increasing productivity and maintaining the meekness of the work-force through different power models—each binding the workers to the work process in its own way—I will conclude that in warehouses, rebellion and worker organization are prevent-ed by a fear of discipline, while in branches, they are prevented by identification with the goal of achieving the required productivity. Accordingly, employees in branches do not primarily direct their dissatisfaction towards the company, but towards colleagues who fail to demon-strate a sufficient degree of collegiality.

                            <p>This paper makes the claim, in dialogue with Levinas and psychoanalysis (inter alia), that anything that shits is worthy of ethical consideration. Along the way, I address the figure of prosopopoeia and the giving of face and voice to others as inadequate ethics for our current crisis. Animals have historically been denied ethical status because they lack a voice: they cannot respond, they’re irresponsible. But an ethics rooted in the voice and, metonymically, the face is, in the end, a humanist ethics, excluding anything nonhuman from the sphere of ethical consideration. Our current ecological and political crisis, however, requires an ethics of the nonhuman. I present a third way in the field of animal ethics, which historically has been divided between the humanist traditions of deontology (animal rights) and utilitarianism (animal liberation). Counter to many arguments for the nonhuman, the shit(mus) test excludes robots and artificial intelligence and I argue that it is very important at our current junction to do just that. To conclude, I turn to poetry and music historically rejected as being too cacaphanous: that is, rejected as sound and fury, signifying nothing—a mere playing with shit—to establish the ethics of shit, not sublimated into the love of money, as an ethics of play rather than an ethics of work. In other words, the ethics of shit is not just an antihumanist ethics, but an anticapitalist ethics of the excluded.

                            <p>I will talk about antihumanist theories of the 21st century, using the example of media archaeology and its position within related theoretical scenes (contacts with accelerationism are rare) and academic scenes (media archaelogy is often reduced to culture studies), as well as internet culture (memes about media archaeology do not exist!). Indeed, radical media archaeology, in particular the work of Wolfgang Ernst, is not only rooted in a conceptual shift from culture to technology, but wants to get rid of the references to the human being and its cultural and cognitive bias altogether. It dispenses with the historical consciousness and eschatology generated by discourse and writing, as well as the ghosts of dead media: time only continues in the function of technology. With the increasing presence of machine intelligence in human culture, the coldness of media archaeology, as Maks Valenčič puts it, is thus only deepened. I will be interested in the next step of media-archaeological anti-humanism: the automation of the humanities.

                        <div id="abstract25" class="abstract">
                            <p>Datafication encourages automation on a large scale, including the most basic aspects of life (Couldry and Mejias 2019). This pushes for increased data demand, resulting in the prolifera-tion of public, private and public-private data repositories (Thylstrup 2022). On the other hand, developments in big data (Beyer & Laney 2012) and the increase in computational pow-er have stipulated the capitalization of AI research, in particular of artificial neural networks (Fazi 2020). However, the low level of interpretability of deep neural networks (Kelleher 2019) has ushered in a myriad of discourses on deep learning. In this regard, Campolo and Crawford argue that these discourses are not just producing techno-optimism, but enchanted determinism as well, shielding creators of these systems from social accountability (2020). By focusing on determinism as it is emerging in discourses related to deep learning and on AI more broadly, this paper will aim to address at least three lines of research: analyze human and machinic learning modes; problematize the notion of autonomy within the context of rep-resentation, abstraction and agency; and discuss the so-called delete culture, which Floridi claims succeeded the cultural trend of recording information (2023) and is specifically inter-esting for its potential evocation of autonomy. Nonetheless, the main preoccupation of this presentation will be to theoretically dwell on the somehow distinctive, double structured character of agency, which is exhibited by human intervention in the training neural networks.

Starting from the 1950s, we have seen a flood of supposed paradigm shifts, which make up a theoretical trend that displays the tendency of each turn becoming an independent discipline within the humanities. This theoretical fascination began with the linguistic turn in the 1960s, which was succeeded by the pictorial and bodily turns in the 1980s, followed by the affective turn in the 1990s, and, most recently, by the sensory turn. The talk sets out to rethink this – by no means exhaustive – trajectory of turns by relating them to the humanism/antihumanism divide.

                            <p>The presentation challenges the widely cited theory of surveillance capitalism, as proposed by Shoshana Zuboff, an American scholar whose work posits a “new logic of accumulation and operations” that allegedly claims human experience as free raw material for conversion into behavioural data. Zuboff argues that this “rogue force,” driven by novel economic imperatives, exploits the “virgin territory” of private human experience, with the development of platforms such as Google and Facebook serving as prime examples. The presentation pinpoints some of the most exaggerated claims within surveillance capitalism theory, which fail to account for various forms of indifference toward moral values rooted in human nature. These assumptions, symptomatic of contemporary anxieties about technology, often adopt a paranoid tone and employ echoes of Orwellian dystopia instead of actual concepts. Moreover, Zuboff’s framework positions privacy as the cornerstone of democratic order and concludes with a sino-phobic fable portraying the final stage of surveillance capitalism’s destructive effects: a future where “true individualism” will perish and machines manipulate people into uniform subjectivities. By offering three counter-arguments – drawing on examples from common online marketing practices, routine data collection and processing, and machine learning development – the presentation will demonstrate that much of what is referred to as “surveillance revenues” or “surveillance capital” can, in fact, be understood as typical online advertising activities rather than a fundamentally new or sinister form of capitalism.

The talk takes its cue from three distinct loci of the ongoing collapse of the distance separating humans from our technological appendages. Sketching out the conceptual value of the notions of bio-mimetics, bio-fabrication, and bio-hybridisation for philosophical inquiry, the talk proceeds by staging an encounter between present-day bio-technological research, on the one hand, and, on the other, Freud’s old anti-humanist insights into the nature of the human as a prosthetic deity.

                    <p>Bernard D. Geoghegan (University of Gothenburg): <span class="collapsible" onclick="toggleContent('abstract31')">The Covert Humanism of ChatGPT</p>
                        <div id="abstract31" class="abstract">
                            <p>For many commentators, user-friendly generative AI technologies, such as Dall-E, ChatGPT, and Runway, herald an onslaught of unreal, informatic simulacra. Media theorist Matthew Kirschenbaum, for example, has predicted a “textpocalypse” in which human-authored texts will be lost in a sea of machine-generated facsimiles. (Indeed, who among us that teaches classes with any sort of intensive reading and writing has not wondered if our students’ critical faculties will be nipped in the bud, snuffed out before they've even been ignited, by the ease and accessibility of generative AI?) But is the situation really so simple and well-defined, such that we can speak of an inhuman informatics that stands opposite the supposed agency, originality, and critical spirit of human readers and writers? This talk argues for a new formulation of the problem, attentive to how recent AI technologies threaten to consolidate and even elevate an anachronistic humanism. Only by transfiguring this entrenched opposition between technics and the human can we achieve a properly humanist (or, for that matter, antihumanist) philosophy equal to the demands of the present.
